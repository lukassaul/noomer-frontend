                    <JustifyText>Noomer is a price comparison website that seeks to offer solutions for prospective buyers/ consumers around the world. Prices for basic commodities tend to vary from City, State, Region or Country. These price variations can be dependent on the economic status of the country PPI, inflation, average salaries, etc.There is a growing demand for contracts and deals that require a unit of account and a numeraire is often used. The platform aims to maintain a set of prices on local goods which could be used as a unit of account for contracts.</JustifyText>

                    <JustifyText>Noomer is extremely useful for time poor people who know what they want or just want to get on with the purchase. Itâ€™s easy, quick, offers plenty of information, and the buying process is a smooth one too when you refer to the provided information on commodities. Noomer helps consumers realise better value when they buy a product.</JustifyText>
